## Weekly Progression Recommendations

### Week-to-Week Progression

**Option 1: Linear Progression (Beginners)**
- Add 5-10 lbs to lower body lifts (squat, deadlift) each week
- Add 2.5-5 lbs to upper body lifts (bench, overhead press) each week
- Continue until you can no longer complete all prescribed reps at RPE 7-8

**Option 2: RPE Progression (Intermediate)**
- Week 1: RPE 7-8 (current program)
- Week 2: Same weights, RPE 8-9
- Week 3: Add 5-10 lbs to lower, 2.5-5 lbs to upper, RPE 7-8
- Week 4: Deload (reduce weight by 10-15%, keep reps same)
- Repeat cycle

**Option 3: Volume Progression**
- Week 1: 5x5 on main lifts
- Week 2: 5x5 with 5-10 lbs added
- Week 3: 6x4 with week 2 weights
- Week 4: Deload (4x4 at 85% of week 1 weights)

### When to Deload
- Every 4-6 weeks
- When performance plateaus for 2+ weeks
- When experiencing joint pain or excessive fatigue
- When RPE consistently reaches 9-10 on working sets

### Deload Protocol
- Reduce weight by 40-50% OR
- Keep weight at 70-80% but reduce sets by 50% OR
- Keep weight moderate (70%) and reduce both sets and reps

## Important Training Notes

### RPE Scale Reference
- **RPE 7:** Could do 3 more reps
- **RPE 8:** Could do 2 more reps
- **RPE 9:** Could do 1 more rep
- **RPE 10:** Maximum effort, no reps left

### Rest Day Recommendations
- **Optimal Schedule:**
  - Monday: Day 1
  - Tuesday: Day 2
  - Wednesday: REST
  - Thursday: Day 3
  - Friday: Day 4
  - Weekend: REST

- **Alternative:** Train any 4 non-consecutive days that fit your schedule

### Recovery Priorities
1. **Sleep:** 7-9 hours per night minimum
2. **Nutrition:** Eat in slight caloric surplus for strength gains (200-300 calories above maintenance)
3. **Protein:** 0.8-1g per pound bodyweight daily
4. **Hydration:** Half your bodyweight in ounces of water daily
5. **Active Recovery:** Light walking, stretching on rest days

### Form Check Protocol
- Record your main lifts from multiple angles
- Review between sets or after training
- Focus on one cue at a time when correcting form
- Never sacrifice form for weight

### Safety Reminders
- Always use safety bars on rack for squats
- Use safety bars or spotter arms for bench press
- Start conservative with weights - you can always add more
- If experiencing sharp pain (not normal muscle burn), stop immediately
- Warm up thoroughly, especially in cold environments

## When to Adjust This Program

**Increase Volume/Intensity If:**
- Completing all sets at lower RPE than prescribed
- Recovery feels easy
- No longer seeing progress after 3-4 weeks

**Decrease Volume/Intensity If:**
- Unable to complete prescribed sets/reps
- Experiencing joint pain
- Sleep quality declining
- Motivation significantly dropping

**Seek Professional Help If:**
- Sharp, acute pain during or after lifting
- Pain that persists beyond 48 hours
- Numbness or tingling in extremities
- Previous injury flaring up

## Final Coaching Notes

This program is designed to build a solid strength foundation across the three powerlifting movements. The key to long-term success is consistency, progressive overload, and quality movement patterns.

**Remember:**
- Perfect practice makes perfect - prioritize form over weight
- Rest and nutrition are when you actually get stronger
- Track your weights, sets, and reps in a training log
- Be patient - strength takes time to build
- Listen to your body - some days will feel harder than others

**Progressive Overload Hierarchy:**
1. Improve technique with same weight
2. Add reps (e.g., 5x5 becomes 5x6)
3. Add sets (e.g., 5x5 becomes 6x5)
4. Add weight (smallest increment possible)

Good luck with your training. Stay consistent, stay safe, and the strength will come.
