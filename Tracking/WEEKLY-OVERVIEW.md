## Important Training Reminders

- Stop immediately if sharp pain occurs

### Recovery Essentials
1. **Sleep:** 7-9 hours per night

3. **Protein:** 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight daily (~148g for this plan)
4. **Hydration:** Half bodyweight in ounces of water
5. **Active Recovery:** Light walking on rest days

- Add 2.5-5 lbs to upper body lifts (bench, overhead press)
- Continue until unable to complete all reps at RPE 7-8
- Track all weights in workout-checklist.csv

**Deload Every 4-6 Weeks:**
- Reduce weight by 40-50% OR
