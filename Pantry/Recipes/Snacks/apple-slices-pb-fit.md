## Ingredients

- 2 medium apples (Honeycrisp, Gala, or Fuji)
- 4 tbsp PB Fit powder
- 2-3 tbsp water

## Instructions

1. Mix PB Fit powder with water until smooth peanut butter consistency
2. Add more water if too thick, more powder if too thin
3. Wash and core apples
4. Slice apples into wedges (about 8 per apple)
5. Arrange on plate with PB Fit dip in center
6. Serve immediately (apples brown over time)

## Notes

- **Storage:** Prep PB Fit in advance; slice apples fresh to prevent browning
- **Prevent Browning:** Toss apple slices in lemon water if prepping ahead
- **Substitutions:** Original recipe calls for almond butter - we use PB Fit (lower calorie, household preference)
- **Banana Allergy:** This recipe is banana-free and safe for her
- **Extra Protein:** Sprinkle with chia seeds or hemp hearts
